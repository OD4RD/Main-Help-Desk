<p><h3><i><strong> About OD4RD project</strong></i></h3></p> https://od4rd.eu

* OD4RD(2) project generally aims to advance the **implementation of ORPHAcodes** in hospitals hosting the European Reference Networks (ERNs). 

The OD4RD(2) project builds on the specific Orphanet expertise, and on its organisation as a long-lasting, well-established network, to fullfil the following general objectives:
1.	To contribute to the generation of standardised, interoperable data on RD diagnosis for primary and secondary use, by the maintenance and the support to the implementation of the Orphanet nomenclature of RD.

2.	To contribute to the harmonisation of data collection amongst settings (health records, registries) and amongst countries, by the dissemination of good coding practices at the data source level.

3.	To contribute at supporting evidence-based decision-making in the frame of the European strategy around ERNs, by supporting the exploitation of reference corpus of data and information on RD.
